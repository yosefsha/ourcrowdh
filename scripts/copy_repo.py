"""Copy this repository's contents to a destination folder.

The destination may already exist (e.g. an existing project root) or not
(it will be created). Files/folders are merged into the destination,
overwriting any same-named files that already exist there.

A generated project gets exactly one backend stack, and `--backend` is
required: which one a project is built on is not a detail to be inherited
from a default. `--backend python` keeps the FastAPI instructions, agent
and CI job; `--backend nestjs` keeps the NestJS ones and drops the Python
ones. The unused stack's CLAUDE.md section goes with its doc, so the
generated CLAUDE.md never imports a file that isn't there.

Every flag is mandatory, and each boolean takes an explicit pair of forms.
What a generated project contains is not something to get by omission: the
caller states the backend, whether infrastructure comes along, and whether the
backend is instrumented for tracing.

This repo's `.git` is never copied. A destination that inherited it would
inherit this repo's history and its `origin`, and its own first commit would
be a deletion of whatever these flags excluded — see EXCLUDES below.

`--infra` covers the `infra/` folder, `docs/infra-instructions.md`, the
CLAUDE.md section importing it, and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which
deploys to the stacks in `infra/` and does nothing without them. `ci.yml` and
`claude-review.yml` are not infrastructure and always copy.

`--with-otel` keeps the "Tracing (OpenTelemetry)" section of whichever backend
instructions doc ships — the console-exporter setup for local debugging and the
OTLP swap for a deployed environment. `--without-otel` drops that one section;
the rest of the doc is untouched, and nothing outside it references tracing.

Usage:
    python scripts/copy_repo.py /path/to/dest --backend python --no-infra --with-otel
    python scripts/copy_repo.py /path/to/dest --backend nestjs --infra --without-otel
